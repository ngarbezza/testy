# Social Preview Image

This directory contains the social preview image (`repository-social-preview.png`) that appears when the Testy repository is shared on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

## Image Details

- **Size**: 1280x640 pixels (GitHub's recommended dimensions)
- **Content**: Shows the console output of running Testy tests, demonstrating the framework in action
- **Purpose**: Provides a visual representation of what Testy does when the repository link is shared

## How it was created

The image was generated using a custom HTML template that recreates the terminal output appearance, then captured as a screenshot to ensure pixel-perfect rendering of the console text and styling.

## GitHub Social Preview

GitHub automatically uses this image as the social preview when:
- The repository link is shared on social media
- The image is named `repository-social-preview.png` and placed in the `.github` directory
- The image meets GitHub's size requirements (1200x630 minimum, 1280x640 recommended)

The image showcases Testy's core value proposition: a simple, educational testing framework with clear, readable output.
