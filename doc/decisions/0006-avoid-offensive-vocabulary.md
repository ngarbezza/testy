# 6. Avoid offensive vocabulary

Date: 2021-01-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There is an initiative about questioning the technical vocabulary we use, and avoiding some words that are widely used
and may offend people. This is a project that adheres to this initiative, therefore...

## Decision

Remove all existing technical vocabulary that might be offensive, and prevent those terms to be added in the future.
For instance, the use of "master/slave" replaced by "main/replica" (or similar), or "whitelist/blacklist" by
"safelist/blocklist" (or similar).

## Consequences

* Supporting causes like Black Lives Matter and let all people know that their voices are heard.
* Having a friendly place for all contributors around the world.
